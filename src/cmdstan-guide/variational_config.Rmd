# Variational Inference Algorithm: ADVI

Stan implements an automatic variational inference algorithm, called
Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI)
@Kucukelbir:2015.
ADVI uses Monte Carlo integration to approximate the variational
objective function, the ELBO (evidence lower bound).
ADVI optimizes the ELBO in the real-coordinate space using
[stochastic gradient ascent](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/stochastic-gradient-ascent.html).
The measures of convergence are similar to the
relative tolerance scheme of Stan's
[optimization algorithms](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/optimization-algorithms-chapter.html).

The full set of configuration options available for the `variational` method is
reported at the beginning of the sampler output file as csv comments.
When the example model `bernoulli.stan` is run with `method=variational`
via the command line with all default arguments,
the resulting Stan csv file header comments show the complete set
of default configuration options:
```
# method = variational
#   variational
#     algorithm = meanfield (Default)
#       meanfield
#     iter = 10000 (Default)
#     grad_samples = 1 (Default)
#     elbo_samples = 100 (Default)
#     eta = 1 (Default)
#     adapt
#       engaged = 1 (Default)
#       iter = 50 (Default)
#     tol_rel_obj = 0.01 (Default)
#     eval_elbo = 100 (Default)
#     output_samples = 1000 (Default)
```

The console output includes a notice that this algorithm is considered to be experimental:
