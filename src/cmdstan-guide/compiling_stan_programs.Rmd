# Compiling a Stan Program


## Invoking `make` 

A Stan program must be in a file with extension `.stan`.
The CmdStan makefile rules specify all necessary steps to
translate files with suffix `.stan` to an executable program.
This is a two-stage process:  first the Stan program is
translated to C++ by the `stanc` compiler, then the
C++ compiler compiles all C++ sources and links them together
with the CmdStan interface program and the Stan and math libraries.

To compile Stan programs, you must invoke `make` from `<cmdstan-home>` directory.
The Stan program can be in a different path, but the path to the Stan
program must not contain a space. (This is a limitation that's
introduced by `make`.) Relative paths are ok; the relative path
must not contain a space.

```
> cd <cmdstan_home>
```

When calling `make`, the target is name of the executable file
corresponding to the Stan program file.
On Mac and Linux, this is the name of the Stan program with the `.stan`
omitted. On Windows, replace `.stan` with `.exe`, and make
sure that the path is given with slashes and not backslashes.
To build the Bernoulli example, on Mac and Linux:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
On Windows, the command is the same with the addition of `.exe`
at the end of the target (_note the use of forward slashes_):
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe
```

The generated C++ code (`bernoulli.hpp`), object file (`bernoulli.o`)
and the compiled executable will be placed in the same directory as the Stan program.

The compiled executable consists of the Stan model and the CmdStan command line interface
which provides inference algorithms to do MCMC sampling, optimization, and variational inference.
The following sections provide examples of doing inference using each method
on the example model and data file.
