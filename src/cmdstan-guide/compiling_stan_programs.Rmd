# Compiling a Stan Program

A Stan program must be in a file with extension `.stan`.
The CmdStan makefile rules specify all necessary steps to
translate files with suffix `.stan` to a CmdStan executable program.
This is a two-stage process:

- first the Stan program is translated to C++ by the `stanc` compiler
- then the C++ compiler compiles all C++ sources and links them together
with the CmdStan interface program and the Stan and math libraries.

## Invoking the Make Utility

To compile Stan programs, you must invoke the Make program from
the `<cmdstan-home>` directory.
The Stan program can be in a different directory, but the directory path
names cannot contain spaces - this limitation is imposed by Make.
```
> cd <cmdstan_home>
```

In the call to Make, the target is name of the CmdStan executable
corresponding to the Stan program file.
On Mac and Linux, this is the name of the Stan program with the `.stan`
omitted. On Windows, replace `.stan` with `.exe`, and make
sure that the path is given with slashes and not backslashes.
To build the Bernoulli example, on Mac and Linux:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
On Windows, the command is the same with the addition of `.exe`
at the end of the target (_note the use of forward slashes_):
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe
```
The generated C++ code (`bernoulli.hpp`), object file (`bernoulli.o`)
and the compiled executable will be placed in the same directory as the Stan program.

The compiled executable consists of the Stan model and the CmdStan command line interface
which provides inference algorithms to do MCMC sampling, optimization, and variational inference.
The following sections provide examples of doing inference using each method
on the example model and data file.

## Dependencies

When executing a `make` target, all its dependencies are checked
to see if they are up to date, and if they are not, they are rebuilt.
If the you call `make` with target `bernoulli` twice, without any
edits to `bernoulli.stan` or other changes to the system,
the second call to make willis invoked a second time, it will see that it is up to date,
and will not recompile the program:

```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
make: `examples/bernoulli/bernoulli' is up to date.
```
If the file containing the Stan program is updated,
the next call to `make` will rebuild the CmdStan executable.


## Compiler Errors

Stan probabalistic programming language is a programming language with a rich syntax,
as such, it is often the case that a carefully written contains errors.

## Troubleshooting

The stanc compiler is also a program, and while it has been extensively tested,
it may still contain errors such that the generated C++ code fails to compile.
If this happens, report the error, together with the Stan program on GitHub.
This is what a compiler error looks like.
This is what other kinds of errors look like.
