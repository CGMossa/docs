# Standalone Generate Quantities

The `generate_quantities` method allows you to generate additional quantities of interest
from a fitted model without re-running the sampler.

This method requires sub-argument `fitted_params` which takes as its value
an existing Stan csv file that contains a sample from an equivalent model,
i.e., a model with the same parameters, transformed parameters, and model blocks,
conditioned on the same data.
