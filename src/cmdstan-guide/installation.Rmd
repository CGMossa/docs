# CmdStan Installation

To install CmdStan you need:

- The CmdStan C++ source code and libraries.<br>
The most recent CmdStan release is available as a single compressed tarfile
containing all of the CmdStan tools and the Stan and math libraries from GitHub:
https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest

- The GNU-Make utility program for Mac and Linux systems,
or the Windows equivalent `mingw32-make`
which is installed as part of RTools: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/

- A modern C++11 compiler.<br>
C++ compiler versions used for testing and development on Mac, Linux, and Windows
are documented on the Stan GitHub wiki: https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Coding-Style-and-Idioms#supported-cpp-versions-and-compilers


## GNU-Make Utility

CmdStan relies on the GNU-make utility to build both the
Stan model executables and the CmdStan tools.

GNU-Make builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files
called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program.
Makefiles consist of rules which tell how to process types of files
according to their suffix, in particular, the Stan makefile rules
specify how to process Stan program files with suffix `.stan` into
executable files.

Make is invoked with a list of target file names to build as command-line arguments.
Make uses the makefile rules to find the corresponding
source files.  For example, to compile the Stan program `my_program.stan`,
the make target is `my_program` or `my_program.exe` (on Windows).

Makefile targets can be preceded by zero or more makefile variable name=value pairs.
For example to compile `my_program.stan` for an OpenCL (GPU) machine,
the makefile variable `STAN_OPENCL` is set to `TRUE`:
```
> make STAN_OPENCL=TRUE my_program
```
Makefile variables can also be set by creating a file named `local` in the
CmdStan `make` subdirectory which contains a list of `<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>` pairs,
one per line.  The complete set of makefile variables can be found in file
`cmdstan/stan/lib/stan_math/make/compiler_flags`.

When invoked without any arguments at all, `make` prints a help message

```

CmdStan v2.23.0 help

  Build CmdStan utilities:
    > make build

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler bin/stanc from stanc3 binaries.
    2. Build the print utility bin/print (deprecated; will be removed in v3.0)
    3. Build the stansummary utility bin/stansummary
    4. Build the diagnose utility bin/diagnose
    5. Build all libraries and object files compile and link an executable Stan program

    Note: to build using multiple cores, use the -j option to make, e.g., 
    for 4 cores:
    > make build -j4


  Build a Stan program:

    Given a Stan program at foo/bar.stan, build an executable by typing:
    > make foo/bar

    This target will:
    1. Install the Stan compiler (bin/stanc or bin/stanc2), as needed.
    2. Use the Stan compiler to generate C++ code, foo/bar.hpp.
    3. Compile the C++ code using cc . to generate foo/bar

  Additional make options:
    STANCFLAGS: defaults to "". These are extra options passed to bin/stanc
      when generating C++ code. If you want to allow undefined functions in the
      Stan program, either add this to make/local or the command line:
          STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined
    USER_HEADER: when STANCFLAGS has --allow_undefined, this is the name of the
      header file that is included. This defaults to "user_header.hpp" in the
      directory of the Stan program.
    STANC2: When set, use bin/stanc2 to generate C++ code.


  Example - bernoulli model: examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan

    1. Build the model:
       > make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
    2. Run the model:
       > examples/bernoulli/bernoulli sample data file=examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.data.R
    3. Look at the samples:
       > bin/stansummary output.csv


  Clean CmdStan:

    Remove the built CmdStan tools:
    > make clean-all

## Building CmdStan

Building CmdStan involves preparing a set of executable programs
and compiling the command line interface and supporting libraries.
The CmdStan tools are:

- `stanc`: the Stan compiler (translates Stan language to C++).

- `stansummary`: a basic posterior analysis tool.
The `stansummary` utility processes one or more output files from a run
or set of runs of Stan's HMC sampler.
For all parameters and quantities of interest in the Stan program,
`stansummary` reports a set of statistics including mean, standard deviation,
percentiles, effective number of samples, and $\hat{R}$ values.

- `diagnose`: a basic sampler diagnostic tool which checks for indications
that the HMC sampler was unable to sample from the full posterior.

CmdStan releases include pre-built binaries of the Stan language
compiler \url {https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3}:
`bin/linux-stanc`, `bin/mac-stanc` and
`bin/windows-stanc`. The CmdStan makefile `build` task
copies the appropriate binary to `bin/stanc`. For CmdStan
installations which have been cloned of downloaded from the CmdStan
GitHub repository, the makefile task will download the appropriate
OS-specific binary from the stanc3 repository's nightly release.

Steps to build CmdStan:

- Download the latest release from https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest
or clone CmdStan from Github.  The release tarball contains all the Stan and stan_math
sources and libraries.  The GitHub repo contains just the `cmdstan` module; to get the
Stan and stan_math libraries, you must run task `make stan-update` which gets the
stan and stan_math submodules from GitHub.

- Open a command-line terminal window and change directories to the CmdStan directory.
From here on, we'll refer to this location as `<cmdstan-home>`.

- Run the makefile target `build` which instantiates the CmdStan utilities
and compiles all necessary C++ libraries.

```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> make build
```

If your computer has multiple cores and sufficient ram, the build process
can be parallelized by providing the `-j` option. For example, to build on 4 cores, type:

```
> make -j4 build
```

When CmdStan is successfully built, the directory `<cmdstan-home>/bin/`
will contain the executables `stanc`, `stansummary`, and `diagnose` (on Windows, corresponding `.exe` files).
The final lines of output from `make` program will be:
```
--- CmdStan v2.23.0 built ---
```

**Warning:**  _The `make` program may take 10+ minutes and consume 2+ GB of memory to build CmdStan._

**Windows only:** CmdStan requires that the Intel TBB library,
which is built by the above command, can be found by the Windows system.
This requires that the directory
`<cmdstan-home>/stan/lib/stan_math/lib/tbb` is part of the
`PATH` environment variable.
To permanently make this setting for the current user, you may execute:
```
> mingw32-make install-tbb
```
After changing the `PATH` environment variable, you must open an new shell
in order to these setting to take effect.
(This is not necessary on Mac and Linux systems because they can use the
absolute path to the Intel TBB library when linking into Stan programs.)
