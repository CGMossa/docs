# Stan CSV File Format {#stan_csv}

The output from all CmdStan methods is in [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
Fundamentally, it is a data table consisting of zero or more method-specific columns
followed by columns corresponding to the model parameters and/or quantities of interest.

**Note:** CmdStan outputs provide at most 6 decimal places of precision.

Different methods also make (extensive) use of comment lines,
i.e., lines which begin with the `#` character as a way of outputting
additional information about the inference engine and the resulting estimate.

- Header row:  column names
  + method specific variables
  + Stan program variables in block declaration order

- Data rows:  numerical values (including `NaN`, `inf`, `+inf`, `-inf`)
