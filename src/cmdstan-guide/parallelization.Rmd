# Parallelization {#parallelization}

Stan provides three ways of parallelizing execution of a Stan model: 

- multi-threading with Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB),
- multi-processing with Message Passing Interface (MPI) and 
- manycore processing with OpenCL.

## Multi-threading with TBB

In order to exploit multi-threading in a Stan model, the models must be 
rewritten to use the `reduce_sum` and `map_rect` functions. For instructions
on how to rewrite Stan models to use these functions see [Stan's User guide chapter on parallelization](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/parallelization-chapter.html), [the `reduce_sum` case study](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html) or the [Multithreading and Map-Reduce tutorial](https://github.com/rmcelreath/cmdstan_map_rect_tutorial).

### Compiling

Once a model is rewritten to use the above-mentioned functions, the model
must be compiled with the `STAN_THREADS` makefile flag. The flag can be 
supplied in the `make` call but we recommend writing the flag to the 
`make/local` file.

An example of the contents of `make/local` to enable threading with TBB:

```
STAN_THREADS=true
```

The model is then compiled as normal:
```
make path/to/model
```

### Running

Before running a multi-threaded model, we need to specify the maximum number of threads
a single chain can use. This is done by setting the environment variable
`STAN_NUM_THREADS`. On Unix systems we can set it using the `export` command. The 
following would set the maximum number of threads to use for a chain to four:
```
export STAN_NUM_THREADS=4
```
In Windows PowerShell use the following command:
```
Set-Variable -Name STAN_NUM_THREADS -Value "4"
```

Generally, this number should not exceed the number of available cores.
If this variable isn't set, then the program will run with only one thread.

Once `STAN_NUM_THREADS` is set, run a model as normal:
```
./model sample data file=data.json ...
```

## Multi-processing with MPI

In order to use multi-processing with MPI in a Stan model, the models must be 
rewritten to use the [`map_rect` function](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_26/functions-reference/functions-map.html). By using MPI, the model can be parallelized across multiple cores or a cluster. MPI with Stan is supported on MacOS and Linux.

### Dependencies

Compiling and running Stan models with MPI requires that the system 
has an MPI implementation installed. For Unix systems the most commonly used
implementations are [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) and [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/).

### Compiling

Once a model is rewritten to use `map_rect`, additional makefile flags 
must be written to the `make/local`. These are:

- `STAN_MPI`: Enables the use of MPI with Stan if `TRUE`.
- `CXX`: The name of the MPI C++ compiler wrapper. Typically `mpicxx`.
- `TBB_CXX_TYPE`: The C++ compiler the MPI wrapper wraps. Typically `gcc` on Linux and `clang` on macOS.

An example of `make/local` on Linux:

```
STAN_MPI=true
CXX=mpicxx
TBB_CXX_TYPE=gcc
```
The model is then compiled as normal:
```
make path/to/model
```
### Running

The Stan model compiled with `STAN_MPI` is run using an MPI launcher. The MPI standard
suggests using `mpiexec`, but a vendor wrapper for the launcher like `mpirun` can also be used.
The launcher is supplied the path to the built executable and the number of processes to start:
`-n X` for `mpiexec` or `-np X` for `mpirun` where `X` is replaced by the integer representing
the number of processes.

Example for running a model with six processes:
```
mpiexec -n 6 path/to/model sample data file=data.json ...
```

## OpenCL

### Dependencies

OpenCL is supported on most modern CPUs and GPUs. In order to run OpenCL-enabled Stan models,
an OpenCL runtime for the target device must be installed. This subsection lists installation
instructions for OpenCL runtimes of the commonly-found devices.

In order to check if any OpenCL-enabled device and its runtime is already present use the
`clinfo` tool. On Linux, `clinfo` can typically be installed with the default package manager
(for example `sudo apt-get install clinfo` on Ubuntu). For Windows, pre-built `clinfo` binary
can be found [here](https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo#windows-support).

Also use `clinfo` to verify successful installation of OpenCL runtimes.

#### NVIDIA GPU

Linux:

Install the NVIDIA GPU driver and the  NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.
On Ubuntu the commands to install both is:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-460 nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

Replace the driver version (`460` in the above case) with the lastest number at the time of installation.

Windows:

Install the [NVIDIA GPU Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) and [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

#### AMD GPU

Linux:

Install `Radeon Software for Linux` available [here](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-amdgpu-unified-linux-20-40).

Windows: 

We recommend installing the open source [OCL-SDK](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases).

#### AMD CPU

Install the open source [PoCL](http://portablecl.org/download.html).

#### Intel CPU/GPU

Follow Intel's install instructions given [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html) (requires registration).

### Compiling

In order to enable the OpenCL backend the model
must be compiled with the `STAN_OPENCL` makefile flag. The flag can be 
supplied in the `make` call but we recommend writing the flag to the 
`make/local` file.

An example of the contents of `make/local` to enable parallelization
with OpenCL:

```
STAN_OPENCL=true
```

The model is then compiled as normal:
```
make path/to/model
```

### Running

The Stan model compiled with `STAN_OPENCL` can also be supplied the OpenCL platform and device IDs
of the target device. These IDs determine the device on which to run the OpenCL-supported functions on.
You can list the devices on your system using the `clinfo` program. If the system has one GPU and
no OpenCL CPU runtime, the platform and device IDs of the GPU are typically `0`. In that case
you can also omit the OpenCL IDs as the default `0` IDs are used in that case.

We supply these IDs when starting the executable as shown below:
```
path/to/model sample data file=data.json opencl platform=0 device=1
```
