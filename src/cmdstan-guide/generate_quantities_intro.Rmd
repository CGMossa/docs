# Generating Quantities of Interest from a Fitted Model

The [generated quantities block](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/program-block-generated-quantities.html)
computes *quantities of interest* (QOIs) based on the data,
transformed data, parameters, and transformed parameters.
It can be used to:

-  generate simulated data for model testing by forward sampling
-  generate predictions for new data
-  calculate posterior event probabilities, including multiple
   comparisons, sign tests, etc.
-  calculating posterior expectations
-  transform parameters for reporting
-  apply full Bayesian decision theory
-  calculate log likelihoods, deviances, etc. for model comparison

The `generate_quantities` method allows you to generate additional quantities
of interest from a fitted model without re-running the sampler.
Instead, you write a modified version of the original Stan program
and add a generated quantities block or modify the existing one
which specifies how to compute the new quantities of interest.
Running the `generate_quantities` method on the new program
together with sampler outputs from the fitted model
runs the generated quantities block of the new program using
the estimated parameter values from the existing sample.

To illustrate how this works, we add poterior predictive checks to
the example model `bernoulli.stan`.
We create a new model, `bernoulli_yrep.stan` which contains
the following generated quantities block:
```
generated quantities {
  int y_sim[N];
  real<lower=0,upper=1> theta_rep;
  for (n in 1:N)
    y_sim[n] = bernoulli_rng(theta);
  theta_rep = sum(y) / N;
}
```

We compile this model, and then run it with the fit from a previous run of
the original model and the same input data file:

```
> ./bernoulli_yrep generate_quantities ....
```
