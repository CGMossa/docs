# Diagnosing HMC by Comparison of Gradients

CmdStan has a basic diagnostic feature that will calculate gradients of the
initial state and compare them with those calculated with finite differences.
If there are discrepancies, there is a problem with the model or initial states
(or a bug in Stan). To run on the different platforms, use one of the following.

Mac OS and Linux
```
> ./my_model diagnose data file=my_data
```

Windows
```
> my_model diagnose data file=my_data
```

To see how this works, we run diagnostics on the example bernoulli model:

```
> ./bernoulli diagnose data file=bernoulli.data.R
```

Executing this command prints output to the console and as a series of
comment lines to the output csv file.
The console output is:

```
method = diagnose
  diagnose
    test = gradient (Default)
      gradient
        epsilon = 9.9999999999999995e-07 (Default)
        error = 9.9999999999999995e-07 (Default)
id = 0 (Default)
data
  file = bernoulli.data.json
init = 2 (Default)
random
  seed = 2152196153 (Default)
output
  file = output.csv (Default)
  diagnostic_file =  (Default)
  refresh = 100 (Default)

```

The same information is printed to the output file as csv comments, i.e.,
each line is prefixed with a pound sign `#`.
