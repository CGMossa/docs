# Diagnosing HMC by Comparison of Gradients

CmdStan has a basic diagnostic feature that will calculate gradients of the
initial state and compare them with those calculated with finite differences.
If there are discrepancies, there is a problem with the model or initial states
(or a bug in Stan). To run on the different platforms, use one of the following.

Mac OS and Linux
```
> ./my_model diagnose data file=my_data
```

Windows
```
> my_model diagnose data file=my_data
```
